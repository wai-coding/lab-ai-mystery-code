### Case 1: The Infinite Loop

:brain: Prompt used: "What’s wrong with this JS loop? Explain and fix it."
:robot: AI suggested: Increment the loop counter `i` to avoid an infinite loop.
:bulb: My Insight: I realized the function was stuck checking the same element over and over. Adding `i++` fixed it.

### Case 2: The Cryptic Function

:brain: Prompt used: "Explain this function step-by-step and suggest better variable names."
:robot: AI suggested: Rename the function to `isPalindrome`, rename the parameter to `str`, and add comments explaining the split, reverse, and join steps.
:bulb: My Insight: It was interesting to see how something so short can be confusing without clear names. I learned that good variable names and small comments can make a big difference.

### Case 3: The Over-Engineered Mess

:brain: Prompt used: "Simplify this function in plain JavaScript. What’s the intent?"
:robot: AI suggested: The loop was unnecessary, just return `a + b`.
:bulb: My Insight: The original function was so overcomplicated. Sometimes the simplest solution is the best one.
